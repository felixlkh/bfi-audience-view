# BFI Audience View Styling Management

## Description
This project aims to streamline the styling across all microsites under the [BFI Audience View](https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/). Currently, each microsite has its own unique styling implemented through separate stylesheets. This setup leads to inefficiencies as updates to shared styles require manual changes across multiple sites. Additionally, inconsistencies in styling across microsites have emerged over time.

To address these issues, this project seeks to consolidate all styles into a unified styling system. By centralizing the styling logic and grouping it into a single stylesheet, updates and maintenance become more efficient. The goal is to achieve a consistent and harmonized visual identity across all microsites while minimizing redundancy and effort in managing the styles. This involves:

1. **Consolidation**: Bringing together the various stylesheets from different microsites into one.
2. **Conversion to SCSS**: Converting existing stylesheets into SCSS format for enhanced maintainability and extensibility.
3. **Breakdown by Component**: Organizing the stylesheets by component, allowing for easier management and development.
